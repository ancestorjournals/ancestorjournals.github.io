I went with Bill and family to Gary Watson's to see the film on the Book of Mormon story of Mosiah and sons missionary service. It was very good. He is trying to do produce movies. He is a relative from the Larsen line Soren Larsen so we're cousins removed. A nice man also especially because of belief in fullness of Gospel. I met his son a tall bearded dane - with the sandy reddish beard and saw his beautiful P wife. Brent took Bills station Wagon without permission with Brian Bret and Kurt - the presto came out and created an incident and teaching period. Bill took me Tuesday to get me HotPoint used kitchen stove for $20.00. He had gotten the refrig - same price so the boys helped him move them.
