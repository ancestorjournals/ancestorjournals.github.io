Bill bought batteries on his way home. I visited Sigrid and Steve while he worked in Malad. He was successful in getting quite a few. I read the book "Other Drums" story of Edward Partridge--first Presiding Bishop of the Church. So the day passed and we arrived home safely after dark, tired out, but thankful for the trip.

The visit and luncheon with Sigrid and Steve abd their showing Bill and I their New Zealand mementos was pleasant.

The weather was fair. I checked to see if my watch was fixed--no. Had a visit also with Margaret Sweeten.
