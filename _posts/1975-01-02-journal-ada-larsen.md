Bill and I took the stove to Holbrook. Joye had insisted I buy a Franklin Fireplace for Holbrook so I was persuaded to get it and take. I felt maybe it would be a good investment. As we moved it into the house (against my will) I wasn't sure. I feel if it was right to get it the use of it will be provided also. Bill had Jay Hansen, Frank Hill, and son Nord help move it in. Bill installed the electric stove and it is just fine. He fixed another large unit from the old. We stayed all night. Chipper was so delighted to see me. Bill and I went to Don and Carol Eliason's. Don had broken bones in leg snow-mobiling. Judy was home from her mission. It was nice to see their lively room, beautifully paneled, carpeted, and Franklin Fireplace, and their sweet spirits so heart warming.
